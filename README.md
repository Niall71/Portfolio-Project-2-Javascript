## Introduction

I built this site for my Code Institute portfolio project 2. The purpose behind this site was to showcase a fully functional JavaScript program. In this case a pretty simple take on the classic rock, paper, scissors game, in addition it was to be on a functional website. I wanted to implement the lessons learned through the previous css, and html modules, and then include what we have learned in our JavaScript module. I hope that I have accomplished this. 

As this was my first time getting my own JavaScript program up and running, and hosted live, I wanted it to be fairly simple. The focus of the site it clear, with little extreneous information. Immediately on the site you are presented with the game, and the buttons required to play the game. Additionally the game can be repeated as many times as the user wishes. 

The site can be reached here: <a href="https://niall71.github.io/Portfolio-Project-2-Javascript/" target="_blank"> JavaScript Game </a>

## Site Features

### The Game

This site's primary feature is this JavaScript based game. Simply put you play agaisnt the computer in a five options version of rock, paper, scissors. The idea behind the game was the first example as featured in our LMS portfolio guide. Additionally, as I play video games myself, I was attracted to making a game for my JavaScript project. It is a simple enough game whereby the player chooses one of five options and the computer chooses at random one of those same five options, thereby mimicking the game rock, paper, scissors.

The addition of a reset button allows the player to play again without having to manually reoload the webpage.

I coded the game in my Microsoft Visual Studio, relying heavily on the lessons learned through the LMS.

To add some color and visual interest to the site I included an image of people playing rock, paper, scissors. I took this image from pexels, where it is hosted, and it is coded to not obstruct any pertinent information. Additionally I added alt text to the image, so those using screen readers will know what is being displayed.

### clickable external link

In the contact me section I added a way to get in touch with me, both through email and through an external link. This clicable link will take users to facebook, the link is stylised to be the facebook logo. I added alt text to this link so users reading screen readers will know what is being displayed.
