## Introduction

I built this site for my Code Institute portfolio project 2. The purpose behind this site was to showcase a fully functional JavaScript program. In this case a pretty simple take on the classic 'rock, paper, scissors' game, in addition it was to be on a functional website. I wanted to implement the lessons learned through the previous css, and html modules, and then include what we have learned in our JavaScript module. I hope that I have accomplished this. 

As this was my first time getting my own JavaScript program up and running, and hosted live, I wanted it to be fairly simple. The focus of the site it clear, with little extreneous information. Immediately on the site you are presented with the game, and the buttons required to play the game. Additionally the game can be repeated as many times as the user wishes. 

The site can be reached here: <a href="https://niall71.github.io/Portfolio-Project-2-Javascript/" target="_blank"> JavaScript Game </a>
